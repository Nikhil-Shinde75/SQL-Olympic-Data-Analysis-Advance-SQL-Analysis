# Olympic Dataset SQL Analysis 
In this SQL project, I performed an in-depth analysis of the Olympic dataset to extract valuable insights and answer meaningful questions. The dataset contains comprehensive information about various Olympic events, including athlete details, countries, sports, and medals won.
The main objective of this project was to explore the Olympic dataset using SQL queries.
#
I crafted complex SQL queries to answer a diverse set of analytical questions, such as:
  1] Which nation has participated in all of the olympic games?
  
  2] Find the total no of sports played in each olympic games.
  
  3] which are the Top 5 athletes who have won the most gold medals.
  
  4] which are the Top 5 athletes who have won the most medals (gold/silver/bronze).
  
  5] In which Sport/event, India has won highest medals ? 
  
  6] Break down all olympic games where india won medal for Hockey and how many medals in each olympic games.
  

The analysis highlighted the significance of leveraging advanced SQL techniques to derive comprehensive conclusions from complex datasets.
